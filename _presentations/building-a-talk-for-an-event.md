Building a talk or session or presentation for an event, whether it's your team at work, a user group, small or large in-person conference, or a virtual event takes work and preparation.  What can you do to create the content? What can you prepare for the talk? What do you do if your talk is happening?  What do you do during and after the event?   What do you do after the event?   In this session, we'll go through all of this and look at some tips and tricks that I have developed over the years to make the talks better.

This is similar to the [Presentation Preparedness](presentation-preparedness.md) talk.
