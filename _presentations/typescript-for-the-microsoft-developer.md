Whether you like it or not, if you are building applications for the Web you are going to need to know JavaScript. Sorry, Flash and Silverlight! Unfortunately, JavaScript is not the easiest language to learn or to understand and the tooling for it is not really good. This is where TypeScript comes in. TypeScript is a superset to JavaScript that tries to solve a lot of these problems and make the code more structured, and less error prone. And it also offers tooling support in a way that JavaScript just can’t.
