Azure Application Insights helps you to detect issues, diagnoses crashes and track your application usage in your application, both web, and mobile.

Let’s see how you can get alerts on performance and availability issues, monitor our applications usage and performance, get telemetry for our application without needing to redeploy the applications, search traces, and exceptions logs to figure out what is wrong. Oh, did I mention we can monitor Android, iOS, Windows Mobile applications as well as ASP.NET applications?

We’ll also take a look at how we can analyze request load, server performance counters and response times across dependencies. Get multi-dimensional analyzes over standard metrics or define your own. Diagnose exceptions, mobile application crashes, and failed requests, correlating with events and traces.
