Architecting an application can be hard.  What do you do to keep your application flexible to ever constant requirement changes? How do you handle landscape changes (cloud, on-premises, databases)? How do you avoid over-engineering the application? How do I make sure my application plays well with other applications?

In this session, we'll take a look at finding the right balance between writing too much code and too little code. We'll look at how you can make some improvements in your application to support quick changes, flexibility, and scalability.

You'll walk away with some knowledge, tips, and tricks that you'll be able to use for new and existing applications.
