Microsoft Azure has a lot to offer us as developers. Looking at the product list can be daunting at times. In this session, we will look at how we can take an on-premises ASP.NET Core application that uses SQL and host it in Microsoft Azure.

We'll walk through publishing this application as a Web Application, creating an Azure SQL database to host our data and wrap it up by adding some application logging and telemetry with Azure Monitor's Application Insights.

At the end of the talk, we will have taken the on-premises application and moved it to the cloud with only a few clicks and some knowledge.
