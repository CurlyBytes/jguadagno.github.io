<h2><a name="Experience"></a>Experience</h2>

<h3>Senior Software Engineer <small>IO - Phoenix, AZ</small></h3>
<h5>1/2013-8/2013</h5>
<p class="text-justify">
As a Senior Software Engineer, I was tasked with doing research, design and or discovery for new features or products to add to the company software products. I was also tasked with research existing problems and looking for solutions to them. I also presented at several "Lunch and Learns" to teach fellow software developers new technology.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
One of my other tasks was to help set the standard and best practices for development. This including improving the current software developer standards document, establish processes for software development and choose the right tools to help with the process.
</p>

<h3>Technology Lead and Technology Advisor <small>Wells Fargo - Chandler, AZ</small></h3>
<h5>6/2006 - 1/2013</h5>
<p class="text-justify">
As the Technology Advisor, I was charged with creating and implementing development coding standards, development best practices, and common development software for the Technology Operations group, approximately 400 developers. In addition, I acted as the internal developer evangelist for Microsoft development technologies. I provided several internal training classes on architecture and development for groups ranging from 5 – 200 people. I was all tasked as a “hired gun” to join troubled projects a fix them up and/or help out projects that were troubled with implementing or integrating technologies. I implemented an internal NuGet server for common and internal libraries.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
I was the lead developer for several internal applications as well as third-party implementation projects.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
I sat on the Source Code Control Advisory committee tasked with setting the standards for Source Code Control standards for the entire bank. I assisted in the implementation of the Enterprise Microsoft Team Foundation Server.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
I implemented a metric reporting system which consumed data from multiple locations, performed calculations on those metrics, and then display them on screen. To accomplish this I implemented a pluggable framework which loads and schedules .NET assemblies dynamically to consume feeds from multiple locations and perform the calculations.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
I also started an internal .NET user group to provide education on .NET technologies, standardization of tools and build out an internal community.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
I improved the performance and reliability of the “CORE” application, this application uses a custom threading library, custom TCP/IP messaging a ClearQuest objects to automate the movement of defects and code packages through the ClearQuest workflow. The CORE system generated approximately 300 error messages a day, after a month of debugging and coding the error messages was reduced to one to two a week.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Created a custom ADO.NET provider and SQL client application for querying the ClearQuest data store using SQL syntax. This involved the parsing of incoming SQL requests (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT) and convert it to the corresponding ClearQuest API calls.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Created a web service the queries the ClearQuest data store using either web services protocols or JavaScript objects.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
For many of these applications, I generated unit test and executed them with NUnit and added additional logging with log4net.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Another project that I created was a custom task scheduler, similar to that of the Windows Scheduler, with a few exceptions. This application allowed the user to create a task using any .NET language. Once created the plug-in or task would be placed in the plug-ins folder and on the next restart of the scheduler the plug-in would be loaded and executed based on its schedule.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Created custom CodeSmith templates, a CodeSmith SqlLite schema provider, and a CodeSmith template to generate NUnit tests for an existing .NET assembly.
</p>
<h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
C#, SQL Server 2008, Windows Services, Entity Framework, Team Foundation Server (TFS), Visual Studio, jQuery, jQueryUi, Telerik Controls, NHibernate, ELMAH, WCF, Log4Net, Custom Threading Library, Custom TCP/IP messaging, CodeSmith, NUnit, SQLite, Oracle, Custom CodeSmith Schema Provider.

Application performance was dramatically improved (search speeds when from 3 minutes for 600 records to 3-17 seconds for 1200 records), page load times when from 45-60 to about 5 seconds. The user interface was also improved dramatically be using Ajax technology to dynamically load pages (or sections of) when needed. The security, menu, and database interfaces were improved. I was also tasked with reviewing third party developed code to ensure it was following general programming requirements and design.
</p>

<h3>Project Manager <small>Guardian Life Insurance Company - New York, NY</small></h3>
<h5>12/1998 - 7/2005</h5>
<p class="text-justify">
I managed a project for Guardian’s Individual Market profit center. This application was designed to enable for faster underwriting of the insurance applications. This was accomplished by having the agencies scan or fax in their application to our capture system which in term indexed them for storage in the FileNet repository. I was responsible for getting the project approved, designing, developing, implementation and supporting the project. The project team consisted of 4 developers, 1 DBA, 1 system administrator and me. I managed this project from end to end. Project Life Cycle: Full Cycle.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
I started on the team as the lead developer, but I am now the project manager, to build the Billing Information Storage and Retrieval System that is currently in production. While working on the team my responsibilities entailed, installing and configuring a FileNet Image Services server, implementing a Datacap capture system, creating a Visual Basic front end and an Intranet based front end to query the FileNet repository. I also built several scripts for retrieving a data file from the corporate main frame and uploading to the Oracle validation database. I was also responsible for training all of the users on administration and use of the BISAR system. Other responsibilities included evaluating other capture and imaging products for use in production. In building the Intranet application to query the FileNet repository, I designed and developed a connection pooler to FileNet.
