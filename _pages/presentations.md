### Bootstrap 4.0. What is it? How to use it

Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework in the world for building responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. Let’s see how you can take your website to the next level using Bootstrap. We’ll start with a simple everyday site and add some “pop” to it with Bootstrap. We’ll make the site responsive, consistent, theme-able, mobile-friendly and pleasant to interact with.

We’ll explore the grid layout, flexbox, typography, buttons, list and more.

### Getting Starting with Ionic v4

Ionic lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. The [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) is a free and open source library of mobile-optimized HTML, CSS and JS components along with tools for building highly interactive native and progressive web apps. Built with Sass, optimized for AngularJS.

In this session, we’ll introduce you to the Ionic Framework.  We’ll cover what the framework is, how you set up your development environment, what makes up the framework and the pieces of the framework.  After this, you’ll be well on your way to building your first mobile application with the Ionic Framework.

### Build a Native Mobile Application using Ionic and JavaScript

Ionic lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. The [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) is a free and open source library of mobile-optimized HTML, CSS and JS components along with tools for building highly interactive native and progressive web apps. Built with Sass, optimized for AngularJS.

In this session, you will see how you can build rich powerful, robust, mobile applications that are clean simple and functional. These applications can use [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/), [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) to deploy natively or be a modern day web application.

All you need for this session is to know are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: the building blocks of the web. You’ll even learn AngularJS as you work with Ionic and this talk.

### Build a Native Mobile Application using React Native and JavaScript

React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.

With React Native, you don’t build a “mobile web app”, an “HTML5 app”, or a “hybrid app”. You build a real mobile app that’s indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

### TypeScript for the Microsoft Developer

Whether you like it or not, if you are building applications for the Web you are going to need to know JavaScript. Sorry, Flash and Silverlight! Unfortunately, JavaScript is not the easiest language to learn or to understand and the tooling for it is not really good. This is where TypeScript comes in. TypeScript is a superset to JavaScript that tries to solve a lot of these problems and make the code more structured, and less error prone. And it also offers tooling support in a way that JavaScript just can’t.

### Introduction to ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is a newish open-source and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based internet connected applications, such as web apps, IoT applications, and mobile backends. ASP.NET Core apps can run on [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/platform) or on the full .NET Framework. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

We’ll do a quick overview of ASP.NET Core, then we’ll build application or two using web API, web UI, and ASP.NET Core MVC.

### Improve your Application Debugging with IntelliTrace

Traditional or live debugging shows only your applications current state with limited data about past events. You either have to guess what happened based on your current state, or you have to recreate these events by rerunning your app.

IntelliTrace expands this traditional debugging experience by recording specific events and data at these points in time. This lets you see what happened in your application without restarting it, especially if you step past where the bug is. IntelliTrace is turned on by default during traditional debugging and collects data automatically and invisibly. This lets you switch easily between traditional debugging and IntelliTrace debugging to see the recorded information.

In this session, we will cover what event information Intellitrace collects, like debugger events, exceptions, .NET framework events and more. We’ll also dive in and see how you can further debug your application by using Intellitrace.

### Look into your Application with Azure Application Insights

Azure Application Insights helps you to detect issues, diagnoses crashes and track your application usage in your application, both web, and mobile.

Let’s see how you can get alerts on performance and availability issues, monitor our applications usage and performance, get telemetry for our application without needing to redeploy the applications, search traces, and exceptions logs to figure out what is wrong. Oh, did I mention we can monitor Android, iOS, Windows Mobile applications as well as ASP.NET applications?

We’ll also take a look at how we can analyze request load, server performance counters and response times across dependencies. Get multi-dimensional analyzes over standard metrics or define your own. Diagnose exceptions, mobile application crashes, and failed requests, correlating with events and traces.

### A lap around Microsoft Azure

Let’s take a look at what Windows Azure has to offer us as developers. We will look at how easy it is to create a website, use a Virtual Machine, run an SQL Server database, use Microsoft Azure storage, and more.

[Back to top](#presentations)

### Using Microsoft Azure Storage Services

Azure provides scalable, durable cloud storage, backup and recovery solutions for any data, large and small. It works with the infrastructure you already have to cost-effectively enhance your existing applications and business continuity strategy, and in addition, provides storage required by your cloud applications including unstructured text or binary data such as video, audio, and images.

Let’s take a look to see how we can leverage, Blob Storage to store large amounts of unstructured text or binary data like photos. Use Queues to provide a reliable messaging system that allows implementing scheduling of asynchronous tasks and implement persistent messaging. And Tables to store some unstructured (log) data.
