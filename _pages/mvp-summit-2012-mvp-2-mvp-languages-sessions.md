<h2>Session Details</h2>
<h3><a name="1"></a>Consuming and Publishing data in the Windows Azure Marketplace</h3>
<p>This talks is an overview of the dozens of databases that can be consumed from the Windows Azure Marketplace, many for free or nearly free. Includes data from the United Nations on global issues, the U.S. FBI on crime, Zillow on real estate, China business KPIs, and U.S. demographics by zip code, and others. This data is easily consumed by Excel or as an OData web service. Plus you can easily publish your own data in the marketplace in a few hours. This is a treasure trove of business data that every MVP should be aware of.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Joe Kunk</p>

<h3><a name="2"></a>Composition using MEF</h3>
<p>*** NOTE: Please schedule this immediately before Steele Price's talk *** MEF, Microsoft's Managed Extensibility Framework, offers a tool to hook up software units in a loosely coupled manner. Very similar to IoC (Inversion of Control) containers, MEF allows discovered or configured resolution of concrete parts corresponding to contract requests. This talk covers composition basics and MEF features including discovery, inference, and metadata.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Kathleen Dollard</p>

<h3><a name="4"></a>"Extending to the Cloud" with Windows Azure</h3>
<p>Extending to the cloud involves developing hybrid applications that leverage the capabilities of cloud based platforms. Many of the Windows Azure solutions developed today involve extending the capabilities of existing applications and infrastructure to leverage the capabilities of Azure. These hybrid applications allow developers to combine the best of both worlds. Existing IT infrastructure can be utilized and the capabilities of cloud platforms used to extend the applications, providing enhanced functionality at minimal cost. Session will highlight how the hosting, compute and storage capabilities in the Window Azure platform can be used to extend on premise applications to the cloud. The rendering of 3D animations and cloud based source control will be used as case studies.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Alan Smith</p>

<h3><a name="5"></a>Software Gardening</h3>
<p>Creating great software is not like construction. It’s more like gardening. In this session you will learn about important software gardening concepts such as soil, water, seeds, light, pruning, insecticide, weeding, and more. Along the way you’ll see processes, concepts, tools, and techniques that you can use in your software gardening project. By applying the ideas presented in this session, your software will be lush, green, and vibrant.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Craig Berntson</p>

<h3><a name="6"></a>Getting The Most From Your MVP Status</h3>
<p>This should be a discussion or open space on getting the most out of your MVP status. The best ways to interact with the product groups, other MVPs, insider groups, etc. I've been an MVP for a couple of years now and I am still not sure I am getting the most (or giving the most) out of that status.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Lee Brandt</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="7"></a>The dynamic keyword in the real world</h3>
<p>The dynamic keyword was introduced on .NET framework 4 but hasn't gained a lot of fans so far. In this short session I will try to browse a few real-world scenarios where the dynamic keyword might fit in, and try, with your help, to get to a conclusion - whether the dynamic keyword is useful or not.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Shay Friedman</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="8"></a>Silverlight 5 PivotViewer</h3>
<p>Silverlight 5 introduced the second version of the PivotViewer control, formerly a Live Labs product that is built on the DeepZoom technology. PivotViewer allows you to present large amounts of data in a visual and interactive way. It also includes an inteface for built in searching, filtering, and sorting capabilities. See the PivotViewer in action and learn how it can be integrated into your applications.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Tony Champion</p>

<h3><a name="10"></a>Using the SQL Server Compact Toolbox Visual Studio add-in</h3>
<p>A quick demo of the time saving features of the SQL Server Compact Toolbox add-in, that is a required tool for anyone using SQL Server Compact with Visual Studio<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>ErikEJ</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="11"></a>Functional Testing: Going Beyond Simple Validations. What's Next?</h3>
<p>Functional test tools/frameworks make it easy to do workflows and validations. I'm interested in talking about what we should be looking at next. Should tools help us look at the domain model? What about test oracles for true validation at the system level, not just the UI? Should we be thinking about the equivalents of cyclomatic complexity for our functional tests?<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;Jim Holmes</strong>...</p>

<h3><a name="13"></a>Alternative to WCF RIA Services</h3>
<p>You know WCF RIA Services and you find that many things are missing? In this session you will discover an alternative to WCF RIA Services based on "classic" WCF generated using T4<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Matthieu MEZIL</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="14"></a>ALM Practices - Is my project too small to be worth it?</h3>
<p>Much is written on ALM practices for larger projects, and there is often the perception that there is too much overhead to provide sufficient benefit at the lower end of the spectrum. This talk will examine the application of TFS 2010 and general Agile practices in a variety of projects. The primary focus will be the development of a critical application by a 6 man team in a 12 week period.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>David V. Corbin</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="15"></a>Effective Data Visualization: The Ideas of Edward Tufte</h3>
<p>We spend much of our time collecting and analyzing data. That data is only useful if it can be displayed in a meaningful, understandable way. Yale professor Edward Tufte presented many ideas on how to effectively present data to an audience or end user. In this session, I will explain some of Tufte's most important guidelines about data visualization and how you can apply those guidelines to your own data. You will learn what to include, what to remove, and what to avoid in your charts, graphs, maps and other images that represent data.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>David Giard</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="16"></a>Using the Database features of Visual Studio 2010</h3>
<p>Visual Studio provides a set of integrated tools that assist developers in managing and deploying SQL Server database objects. In this session, I will explain and demonstrate how to use as many of the following tools as time allows: • Database projects • Refactoring Database objects • Schema Compare tool • Data Compare tool • Generating Data • Database Unit Tests<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>David Giard</p>

<h3><a name="17"></a>Architecting for a Mobile World</h3>
<p>The world is going mobile, is your architectural mindset going with it? The days of the monolithic application and even simple demos are numbered, while these may live on in legacy support for some time, their usefulness will diminish rapidly. How do we change the way we think about building applications in a world filled with Clouds and Mobile Devices yet still provide a powerful desktop experience? Come see how we built a new social application designed and created for just that purpose.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Steele Price</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="18"></a>Frank: the Web API DSL</h3>
<p>Minimize your Web API development with Frank.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Ryan Riley</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="19"></a>Understanding Computation Expressions</h3>
<p>Computation expressions are one of the most interesting features to learn when coming to F# from C# or VB, but also one of the most intimidating. There's literally nothing like it. Come learn what they are, how they work, and why they're so useful.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Richard Minerich</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="21"></a>Barb - A Simple Dynamic Language Similar to F#</h3>
<p>Barb was born out of necessity. I needed a weakly typed dynamic and expression oriented language that hosted nicely inside of .NET applications for application users but nothing seemed to fit the bill. At first Barb was only good for predicate logic, but a few months into the project it now supports a reasonable subset of F# features. Feedback of all kinds is welcome!<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Richard Minerich</p>

<h3><a name="22"></a>Composable mobile UIs with F# and WebSharper</h3>
<p>In this talk I will demonstrate how to build composable, type-safe mobile UIs for Android and Windows Phone using F# and WebSharper, the versatile open source web and mobile development framework for F#.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Adam Granicz</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="23"></a>FAKE - F# Make</h3>
<p>"FAKE - F# Make" is a build automation system, which is intended to provide a better tooling support than MSBUILD. Due to its integration in F#, all benefits of the .NET Framework and functional programming can be used, including the extensive class library, powerful debuggers and integrated development environments like Visual Studio 2010 or SharpDevelop, which provide syntax highlighting and code completion. The talk shows how FAKE can be used to build a small C# application.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Steffen Forkmann</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="24"></a>An Introduction to FSharpx</h3>
<p>FSharpx (https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpx) is an open-source set of libraries that aims to provide a common set of functionality that extends or enhances various aspects of the out-of-the-box F# feature set. In this talk, I'll go over the main building blocks that make up FSharpx and provide a few examples of how you can start taking advantage of this great set of libraries today.<br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Ryan Riley</p>

<h3><a name="25"></a>Meet the Codeplex Team</h3>
<p>The team who owns and runs Codeplex want to make sure Codeplex is your favorite platform for building and sharing community projects. In this session the Codeplex team will be sharing with you some of their thoughts future plans -and of course taking your input to shape the forth coming efforts <br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Mark Groves</p>

<h3><a name="26"></a>Roslyn in t4</h3>
<p>Sometimes, we want to generate code from another code. In this session, Matthieu will present how to use Roslyn in a T4 to parse the original code for generating the new one. <br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Matthieu MEZIL</p>
<p>Back to <a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3><a name="27"></a>Fast, Faster ... Async ASP.NET</h3>
<p>Do you have any page that needs to access a database, or a web service? Do any of those takes longer than 1 second to process on the server side? Do you know what happens to the rest of your application? All those questions will get at least one viable answer during this talk, together with some solution how you can solve the problems that may arise. <br><strong>Presented By :&nbsp;</strong>Tiberiu Covaci</p>
