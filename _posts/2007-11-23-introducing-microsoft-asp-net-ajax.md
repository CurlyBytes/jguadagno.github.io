So far I think every book or article I have read by Dino Esposito has been great, this is no exception!<br />
This book is broken up into three parts: 
<ul>
<li>The building blocks of Ajax</li>
<li>Adding Ajax to an existing site</li>
<li>Client-Centric Development</li>
</ul>
oh yeah, a some bonus content at the end! <br />
Overall this book is an excellent starting place for getting into Ajax development or to have a reference.
