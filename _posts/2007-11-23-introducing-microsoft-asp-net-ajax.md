So far I think every book or article I have read by Dino Esposito has been great, this is no exception!  
This book is broken up into three parts:

* The building blocks of Ajax
* Adding Ajax to an existing site
* Client-Centric Development

oh yeah, a some bonus content at the end!  
Overall this book is an excellent starting place for getting into Ajax development or to have a reference.
