<p>This book is short on the number of pages but not necessarily on content.&nbsp;  The&nbsp;books author approaches&nbsp;Software&nbsp;Development Project Management as a problem  and offers up how you can&nbsp;use <a target="_blank" href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> as a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book starts to talk about what Software Development Project Management is  a how to break it up into its pieces.&nbsp; It then proceeds to introduce how to make  Software Development Project Management easier with <a target="_blank" href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache Web Serve</a>r and <a target="_blank" href="http://comparitech.net/webdav">WebDAV</a>. The book then begins to  describe how to use Trac and Subversion of some of the details of each.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is a good starting point if you want to add Trac and  Subversion to your project.&nbsp; There are two things that I would have liked to see  in the book however.&nbsp; The first is the use of <a target="_blank" href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>&nbsp;client as  opposed to the command line.&nbsp; The second is less use of the command line, while  this is OK for Linux developers and some Windows developers, most do not like to  use command lines.</p>
