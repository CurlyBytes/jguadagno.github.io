<p>Back in January at <a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com/" target="_blank">SoCal Code Camp</a> Fullerton, <a href="http://TheSociableGeek.com" target="_blank">Daniel Egan</a>, <a href="http://woodyp.info" target="_blank">Woody Pewitt</a> and I were chatting about the different camps and how can we collaborate better. That's where the idea of the party bus can up.&nbsp; We said "What about getting a bus from LA to go to Chandler for Desert Code Camp?" If it was successful, we would do the same for the next <a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com/" target="_blank">SoCal Code Camp</a> in San Diego.</p>
<p>That being said, come and join the party bus from Los Angeles County to <a href="http://apr2011.desertcodecamp.com" target="_blank">Desert Code Camp</a>. The tickets are $60 round trip. The  loction will be announced shortly, it will most likely be in Riverside  or Ontario.&nbsp; Drinks and snack will be provided on the bus. Reserve your seat <a href="http://la2dcc2011.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are worried about where you are going to stay, don't. The organizers of Desert Code Camp have partnered up with the <a href="http://www.sanmarcosresort.com/" target="_blank">San Marcos Crowne Plaza</a> in downtown Chandler, AZ to bring you a&nbsp; great hotel deal. Please visit  the Desert Code Camp / San Marcos Crowne Plaza reservation <a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&amp;eventID=3324014&amp;utm_source=55438&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=4565629" target="_blank">page</a> to make you reservation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that the reservation for the  hotel is separate from that of the bus ticket and you will be  responsible for both.</p>
