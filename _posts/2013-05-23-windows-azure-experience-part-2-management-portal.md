This Part 2 of a <a href="http://1222-7915.el-alt.com/post/2013/05/20/The-Windows-Azure-Experience">series of posts</a> about my “upgrade” to Windows Azure.

Next up in this series is the Windows Azure Management Portal.  It can be accessed directly at <a title="https://manage.windowsazure.com/" href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/">https://manage.windowsazure.com/</a> or by visiting <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/">http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/</a> and clicking on the portal link in the upper hand corner.

<a href="http://1222-7915.el-alt.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SNAGHTMLba8532e.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="SNAGHTMLba8532e[5]" src="http://1222-7915.el-alt.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SNAGHTMLba8532e_thumb.png" alt="SNAGHTMLba8532e[5]" width="637" height="46" border="0" /></a>

&nbsp;

To access the portal you will need to sign in with the same Windows Live account that you used to create the account.

<em><span style="font-size: small;">Note: There are two different sign is screens available, one for those the use a Microsoft Account for Office 365 and one that use a “regular” Windows Live account like hotmail.com or msn.com.</span></em>
<h1>Navigation</h1>
The “home page” for the portal is broken up into 4 parts:

<a href="http://1222-7915.el-alt.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image_10.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://1222-7915.el-alt.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image_thumb_9.png" alt="image" width="652" height="339" border="0" /></a>

&nbsp;
<h2>Part 1 - Navigation Bar</h2>
The navigation bar allows you to view documentation, pricing, downloads, community and support. You can also change the language and access your account.
<h2>Part 2 – “Table of Contents”</h2>
This lets you access off of the Windows Azure Services that you have.  There will be a number beneath each services which indicates what have many “items” you have activated with that service.  In my example, I have 1 Web Site and 2 SQL Databases.  You can click on any of these to access the service.
<h2>Part 3 – Main Body</h2>
This is where the settings or actions of the service items live.  In the example above, you see all items which lists all of the services I have and their current status.

For the “All Items” selection you get a list of all the services that you have a subscription and their statuses.  Windows Azure allows you to have multiple subscriptions linked to one account, that is why the subscription column is present.

<h2>Part 4 – App Bar</h2>
The app bar is synonymous with the  Windows 8 app bar, it provides actions that you can take based on what service you are in and what item is selected. In the example above I have a web site selected so I am presented with the ability to:
<ul>
	<li>Create a new Web Site</li>
	<li>Browse the Site</li>
	<li>Stop the Site</li>
	<li>Restart the Site</li>
	<li>Manage Domains</li>
	<li>Delete the Site</li>
	<li>Install Web Matrix</li>
	<li>View (context sensitive) Help</li>
</ul>
