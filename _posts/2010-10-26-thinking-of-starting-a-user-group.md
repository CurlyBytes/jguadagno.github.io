<strong></strong>  <p>A while ago I was asked by a friend of mine in SoCal (Southern California) about how to start a user group. After answering his email I decided it would be nice to have it in a blog post, so here it is.</p>  <p>There are a lot of components to starting a user group.&#160; The biggest are location, time and theme and keeping them consistent. <strong><em>Consistency</em></strong> is important to a successful user group.</p>  <p>   <br /><b>Your location should be consistent</b>. It is OK if you are starting and trying to find a new place to settle in, but once you settle in, keep it that way. Try not to bounce from place to place.</p>  <p>   <br /><b>The time you meet needs to be consistent</b>.&#160; Have it on the same time of the month. Ex: 4th Thursday of the month, 2nd Wednesday. Try to keep in mind other user groups in the area (I know SoCal has tons) and when they meet.&#160; It is difficult for most people to go out more than once a week.     <br /><b>     <br />The theme should be consistent also</b>.&#160; Are you going to be focused around Azure, C#, General .NET, Cloud, etc. See if there are other user groups in the area with the same interest.</p>  <p>   <br /><b>Another thing to keep in mind is communication</b>. Try to get a <a href="http://affiliate.godaddy.com/redirect/CEB1BDB5383B2F58B38C9B23E12CC77BC6777623A11FCFCF15DA2401474B5B8B">domain</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> account all with the same name like <a href="http://sevdnug.org/home.aspx">SEVDNUG</a> (my user group) so that people can remember it.&#160; In the beginning you will need to send out a lot to build up the group.</p>  <p>   <br /><b>Try to solicit help</b>. Starting and maintaining a user group is difficult to do especially for one person. Try to get other people to help you.</p>  <p>   <br /><b>Sponsors</b> Getting sponsorship is hard, especially in beginning, until you have the contacts. Most local recruiting companies are willing to help sponsor pizza and such for a meeting.&#160; Most third party vendors have contacts in their marketing department on their sites.&#160; They are always willing to provide SWAG.&#160; You can also check out the offers page on the <a href="http://ineta.org/offers/">INETA</a> site.    <br /></p>  <p><strong>Additional Help </strong>Check with your local Microsoft developer <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bb905078.aspx">evangelist</a> they should be able to provide some help to get you started. Also look at the INETA <a href="http://ineta.org/MembershipTeam.aspx">Membership</a> mentors to help get you started.</p>
