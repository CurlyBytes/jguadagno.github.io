<p>One thing that I have noticed of the past few years when it comes to conference or “Summits” is that there are a lot of after parties, tweets, etc. that happen.&#160; Most of the time it is difficult to get the word out about these events or even find out about them.&#160; That’s where <a href="http://www.mvpsummitevents.com" target="_blank">MVPSummitEvents.com</a> comes in.&#160; The site will hopefully be a one stop shop to find <strong>public</strong> events that are happening at the Microsoft 2010 MVP Global Summit. </p>  <p>From the site you can add events, create venues, display events, subscribe to the RSS feed or iCal feed, download an event to outlook or calendar client that can consume a .VCS file. <strong>Note</strong>: the creation of events and venues requires you to sign in using your Windows Live Id account, no information from Live is used within our site.</p>  <p>If the site is successful, I plan to white label it to use with other events like MIX2010, TechEd, PDC, etc.</p>  <p>Let me know what you think at <a href="mailto:jguadagno@sevdnug.org">jguadagno@sevdnug.org</a></p>
