This book is built on the beta of version 3.5 of the .NET framework.  Since LINQ is a subset of the language enhancements made to 
.NET 3.5, the author chose to cover some of them also like Local Type Inference, kinda cool but I think it will lead to sloppy code.
Overall I would say go out and get the book since .NET 3.5 is here.

Topics Include:
<ul>
<li>LINQ Introduction</li>
<li>C# Language Features</li>
<li>Visual Basic 9 Language Features</li>
<li>LINQ Syntax Fundamentals</li>
<li>LINQ to SQL</li>
<li>LINQ to XML</li>
<li>ADO.NET Entity Framework</li>
</ul>
