<p>Although this books title states the book is for ASP.NET 3.5 application architecture and design, you will be able to take these concepts well beyond ASP.NET.&nbsp; The concepts and technics that this author conveys can be used for all Windows .NET development.&nbsp; The author starts out explaining basic 1 tier architecture and eventually graduates you to a five tier architecture.</p>
<p>The book covers ER diagrams, domain modeling, common design patterns, SOA, WCF and even database design.&nbsp; This book is a good starter book for those of you that want to move out of the developer role and start learning about basic principals in applications design.</p>
<p>There is only one downside the book and that is the formatting of the code samples.&nbsp; There seems to be an issue with the spacing and tabs (at least in the book).&nbsp; Other than that it is a good read.</p>
<p>You can purchase the book on the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/application-architecture-and-design-for-asp-.net-3.5/book/mid/261108nprnz1">PackT Publishing site</a>.</p>
