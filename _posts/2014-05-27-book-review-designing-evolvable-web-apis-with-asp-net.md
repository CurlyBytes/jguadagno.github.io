<p>When I first learned about this book I could not wait to get my hands on it for two reasons.&#160; One, my current work project involves designing an API for an application to “talk” to a wide variety of systems. The second is one of the authors, <a href="http://codebetter.com/glennblock/" target="_blank">Glenn Block</a>. I’ve known Glenn for a while. I’ve seen him present, I’ve talked with him, read his blog posts and knew the book would not disappoint and it did not.</p>  <p>The book starts off with covering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP" target="_blank">HTTP</a> protocol, then moves into the different types of API styles like the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html" target="_blank">Richardson Maturity Model,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call" target="_blank">RPC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST" target="_blank">REST</a> and others. The authors do this to give the readers an understanding of how the web works and why the <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api" target="_blank">Web API</a> framework in ASP.NET is the way it is. The authors describe, in depth, building out an API, versioning it, applying security, formatting responses and talk about testability of an API.</p>  <p>In short, this book is a must have for anyone working on or designing any API.</p>  <p><i><b>Disclaimer</b></i>: I was given a copy of this book in the hopes that I would review it. I only post reviews on books that I think would provide some benefit to the development community.</p>  <p>Get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449337716/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1449337716&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=beyondthebasic0e&amp;linkId=ZQBIH5TTOE2YWAZP">Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET</a><img style="border-top-style: none !important; border-bottom-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-left-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=beyondthebasic0e&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1449337716" width="1" height="1" /> on Amazon.</p>
