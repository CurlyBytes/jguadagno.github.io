I primarily read this book for the what specifically SQL Server 2005 has as far as CLR integration is concerned. This book was a good overview of all aspects of SQL Server development. It covered T-SQL stored procedures and general SQL queries. From a CLR perspective, it covered the following:

* CLR development (about 12 pages)
* CLR stored procedures (about 20)
* Functions and stored procedures (about 30)
* Advanced topics (about 40)

I guess the point is that there is not much extra stuff you need to know to utilize the .NET CLR in SQL Server 2005.
