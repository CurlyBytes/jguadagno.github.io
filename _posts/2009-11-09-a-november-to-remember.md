<p>And no it is not because the Yankees won the World Series (although congrats to them) it is because it has been an awesome month for me personally and professionally. </p>  <p><strong>On the personal front…</strong></p>  <p>My son’s baseball team, which I am an assistant coach, finished the season undefeated in regular season games (end of year tournament in next week).&#160; My son hit his first over the fence homerun which was a Grand Slam (technically not November but pretty awesome). My daughter's softball team, which I am an assistant coach, finished the season undefeated in regular season games (end of year tournament in next week). </p>  <p>I get to go to fly back to NY in a few days to see family and friends and wish my mother a happy 60th birthday.</p>  <p><strong>On the professional front…</strong></p>  <p>I was elected to the North American <a href="http://www.ineta.org" target="_blank">INETA</a> board of directors.</p>  <p>I was elected to the <a href="http://www.azgivecamp.org" target="_blank">AZGiveCamp</a> executive committee, VP of Operations.&#160; As the VP I will oversee the activities of the Logistics, Sponsorship, Technology and Publicity teams. </p>  <p>I put together my first Code Camp, <a href="http://www.desertcodecamp.com/" target="_blank">Desert Code Camp</a>.</p>  <p>I am presenting a <a href="http://pdcbof.com" target="_blank">Bird of Feather</a> session at PDC with Chris Woodruff on “How to Build and Enrich Your Technical and Local Community” on Tuesday Nov 17 from 11a – 12p.&#160; Stop by if you want to see how to build your community.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>That’s it for now.&#160; Hopefully I can relax a bit in December.</p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="margin:0px; padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;"><br /><br /><script type="text/javascript">
