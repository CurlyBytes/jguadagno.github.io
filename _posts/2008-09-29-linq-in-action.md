<p>I think the expression is &quot;<em>don't cry over spilled milk...</em>&quot;, well  when my son spilled milk on this book I almost cried. Why would you cry over a  book you ask? There are many reasons.&nbsp; Not only does the book go into LINQ in  depth (I know there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988363?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=beyondthebasic0e&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1933988363">C#  in Depth</a><img height="1" border="0" width="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=beyondthebasic0e&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1933988363" alt="" style="border-style: none ! important; margin: 0px;" /> book) but the authors cover all of the parts of the .NET  framework that were created and needed for LINQ to function. In addition, all of  the samples provided are both in C# and VB.NET. These samples are not your basic  &quot;Hello World&quot; samples but useful reusable code snippets that get the point of  the book section across.</p>
<p>The book starts of with an introduction to LINQ and the different versions of  LINQ to&nbsp;<em>xxx,</em> more than enough to wet your whistle. The authors then go  into the prerequisites of the .NET framework required, generics, anonymous types  and lambda expressions.&nbsp; This chapter was so good I read it twice.&nbsp; The third  chapter discusses how LINQ is made up.&nbsp; After this, the authors go in depth in  describing the different types of LINQ, including LINQ to SQL, LINQ to Objects  and LINQ to Amazon with useful examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This book will be a reference book on my book shelf.&nbsp; I expect to  refer to this book constantly.</strong></p>
