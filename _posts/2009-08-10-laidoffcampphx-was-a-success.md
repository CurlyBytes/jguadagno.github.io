<p>Hats off to <a href="http://rachelreese.us/">Rachel Reese</a> for successfully organizing the first Laid Off Camp Phoenix. The event went smooth as could be.&nbsp; I think the highlight of the event was watching all of the networking that went on during the event and after the event at Liberty Market.</p>
<p>Thanks to the sponsors below and all of the volunteers for contributing to the success of the event.</p>
<p>Below is a list of resources that were available in the program.</p>
