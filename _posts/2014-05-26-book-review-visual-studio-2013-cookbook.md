<p>When I first looked at the title of the book Visual Studio 2013 Cookbook I wondered what it could be about.&#160; You canâ€™t cook with Visual Studio, at least not yet :) . It turns out that, outside of two chapters, the book is an series of getting started guides with topics the are new(ish) to Visual Studio 2013. It is not a bad thing. If you are getting started with using Visual Studio 2013 or Team Foundation Server or .NET 4.5.x, this book provides a good overview of the new features in Visual Studio and version 4.5.x of the .NET Framework.</p>  <p><i><b>Disclaimer</b></i>: I was given a copy of this book in the hopes that I would review it. I only post reviews on books that I think would provide some benefit to the development community.</p>  <p>Get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1782171967/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1782171967&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=beyondthebasic0e&amp;linkId=E366A2OH33HLPZLY">Visual Studio 2013 Cookbook</a><img style="border-top-style: none !important; border-bottom-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-left-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=beyondthebasic0e&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1782171967" width="1" height="1" /> on Amazon. </p>
