I posted on Twitter today that Desert Code Camp is not happening this year.  The venue that we use, Chandler - Gilbert Community College is going through some renovations and just could not fit us in this year, unfortunately.  A few people asked what we would need from a venue to help make Desert Code Camp happen.  I put together a list below:
<ul>
	<li>Should be able to support 700-900 people (it grows about 100 people every Code Camp)</li>
	<li>Should have at least 15 rooms
<ul>
	<li>Rooms should have a projector</li>
	<li>At least 7 rooms should be able to accommodate 30 people</li>
	<li>At least 3 rooms should be able to accommodate 75 people</li>
	<li>Preferably have 3 rooms that can support 100+ people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>There should be a large area to host breakfast, lunch, and a sponsor area for all of the attendees</li>
	<li>The venue should have reliable WiFi for the attendees</li>
	<li>Preferably free or very low-cost since this event is free</li>
</ul>
Some nice to have:
<ul>
	<li>A room / venue large enough to hold all of the attendees for an opening and closing keynote.</li>
	<li>Amble (free) parking for the attendees.</li>
</ul>
If you have any questions or would like to throw your venue in the hat, please reach out to me.
