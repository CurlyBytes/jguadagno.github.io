<p>Motivation can be a powerful driver to move you forward in your life, goals and/or projects.&nbsp; For the last few months I have be haphazardly trying to lose some weight, and by haphazardly I mean, that the intend was there just not a lot of motivation.&nbsp; That changed two weeks ago at DevConnections when I had two friends of mine comment on my clothing and overall appearance.&nbsp; One said to my wife, admittedly jokingly, <em>How can you go out with this guy looking like this when you are so beautiful</em> (paraphrasing a bit)? And another making comments while I was working the INETA booth commenting on my attire and general appearance stating (paraphrasing again), <em>How can you represent INETA looking like that?</em> Based on the other comments from that person made thought out the day all I heard was <em>You look like a fat slob! </em>And after looking at myself and hearing what some friends were saying to me, I realized that since my mother passed back in October of 09, and taking on the extra community work that I have let myself go.&nbsp; I tended to wear bagger clothes that were comfortable and I wore sneakers everywhere which was not typical of my style.</p>
<p>Well DevConnections and some friends like <a href="http://www.elijahmanor.com/" target="_blank">Elijah Manor</a>, <a href="http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/04/how-programmer-lost-46-pounds-and.html" target="_blank">loosing 46 pounds</a>, I am now <strong>motivated</strong> again. I am, as of this morning, 238 pounds and according to most charts and sites based on my height I should be around 165 pounds although I would be happy with around 180 pounds. So that means I need to lose 58 pounds which I am capable of doing.&nbsp; In a previous lifestyle change I lost around 75 pounds.</p>
<p>There are many ways that one can do this; surgery, really restricting my diet, going through crash diets or detox diets. I am probably going to go back to watching what I eat and drink with Weight Watchers. I was really successful with this plan in the past.</p>
