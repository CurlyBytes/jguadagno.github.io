<p>At the beginning of 2011, I set a goal for myself to speak at least twice at a community event that was outside of my area, the Phoenix metro area.&#160; There are three reasons for this.&#160; </p>  <ol>   <li>People here are probably sick of me talking :) </li>    <li>I wanted to reach out to other audiences and get feedback on my presenting and talks </li>    <li>The final, was / is a selfish one, to get my name out there </li> </ol>  <p>I have spoken at <a href="http://www.socalcodecamp.com" target="_blank">SoCalCodeCamp</a> 5 times in the last two years and decided that does not count. So I went and submitted talks at <a href="http://codestock.org" target="_blank">CodeStock</a> in Nashville, TN. About a week of so ago, I had to do something that as an event organizer I do not like, I had to cancel my talk at <a href="http://www.codestock.org/" target="_blank">CodeStock</a>. It has nothing to do with the event, just the cost of me speaking there. This lead me to create a poll that I sent out via <a href="http://twitter.com/jguadagno" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Joseph.J.Guadagno" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.&#160; </p> The poll asked a simple question, “<em>What is the most money you will spend out of pocket to speak at a community event? IE: Code Camp, User Groups, etc.”</em>. Although only 22 people responded, the result we pretty much spread evenly across the choices:   <ul>   <li><font color="#35383d">$100: 23%</font> </li>    <li><font color="#35383d">$200: 27%</font> </li>    <li><font color="#35383d">$300: 5%</font> </li>    <li><font color="#35383d">$500: 23%</font> </li>    <li><font color="#35383d">$1000: 18%</font> </li> </ul>  <p>Looking at the results of this scientific poll :), I could not determine anything that I could really use to set the bar for myself.&#160; However, some of the comments I received painted a totally different picture. </p>  <p>   <br />A friend of mine, Paul writes: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>My take on this is that I am affected by my relationship to those who run the event as well (of course) to the proximity of the event. If the person(s) running the event are friends, I am more likely to attend at out-of-pocket cost. If I have no connection, then I am much less likely.</p> </blockquote>  <p>This made me think a bit. I have spent probably $700 or so speaking at SoCalCodeCamp each time. So I asked myself why?&#160; The answer is simple, <strong>Community</strong>. I love helping out and educating people, but one thing I really love is the social aspect of it.&#160; As a result of speaking at SoCalCodeCamp, I have made some good friends in the Southern California area; <a href="http://blog.pewitt.org" target="_blank">Woody</a>, <a href="http://mrdenny.com" target="_blank">Denny</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/scevans" target="_blank">Steve</a>, <a href="http://thesociablegeek.com/" target="_blank">Daniel</a>, <a href="http://davidmccarter.net" target="_blank">David</a> and more.&#160; Now, every time Woody announces the next Code Camp I eagerly submit sessions and look forward to going to speak and hang out with my SoCal friends. </p>  <p>So to summarize, yes there is a cost to speaking outside your area, but there is the <em>potential</em> for making some good friends and expanding your reach and name.&#160; So go and look for Code Camps, Days of .NET, or other community events to speak at and sign up.&#160; Also, register yourself for the <a href="http://www.ineta.org/speakers" target="_blank">INETA Speakers Bureau</a> to help expand your reach.</p>  <p></p>  <ul></ul>
