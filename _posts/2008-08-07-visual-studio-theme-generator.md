I've been looking to PIMP my IDE by changing some of the colors to it.  I came across this [post](http://blogs.msdn.com/gduthie/archive/2008/08/07/visual-studio-theme-generator.aspx) on DEvHammer which pointed [http://frickinsweet.com/tools/Theme.mvc.aspx#](http://frickinsweet.com/tools/Theme.mvc.aspx "http://frickinsweet.com/tools/Theme.mvc.aspx#"). This web application allows you to create a Visual Studio theme based on three colors.

It is Frickin Sweet, as implied by the domain name.
