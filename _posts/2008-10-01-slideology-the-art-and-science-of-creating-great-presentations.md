<p>I typically post reviews of books based on technology topics like .NET, LINQ,  etc. but I thought this book would be a could fit for the site.&nbsp; This book is  about creating effective PowerPoint slides which many technology professionals,  like myself, do on a regular basis. On to the review...</p>
<p>The author breaks up the book into multiple chapters but not your typically  kind of chapters.&nbsp; These chapters are about the different parts that make up a  slide; graphics, displaying data, diagrams, use of movement, etc.&nbsp; Each chapter  is typically closed with a Case Study which demonstrates the use of the technic  or recommend. This is done by showing a before and after presentation.&nbsp; The  author also reinforces&nbsp;her points effectively by using graphics, colors and  illustrations.</p>
<p>The book is chock full of handy tips and suggestions that anyone can use to  create dazzling and effective PowerPoint slides.&nbsp; If you present using  PowerPoint, this is a must have.</p>
