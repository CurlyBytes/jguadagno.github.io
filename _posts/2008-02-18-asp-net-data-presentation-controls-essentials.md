<p>The book is a good starting point for people that was to learn the different  ways of binding data from supported sources to ASP.NET controls.&nbsp; The author  does a pretty good job of explaining the basics of some of the data bindable  controls like ListBox, DropDownList, etc.&nbsp; There are whole chapters dedicated to  the Repeater, DataList, DataGrid and DataView controls.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are a few things that I did not like about the book. The  first was the code, there were quite a few places where the code was not correct  there were typos or incorrect characters to delimitate strings. There where  several locations in the code where double angle brackets (&laquo; &raquo;) where used for  strings instead of double quotes (&quot;).&nbsp; Some of the code samples provided for the  DataManager class were susceptible to SQL Injection attacks. Now I understand it  is a sample but a little disclaimed should be made to break habits.&nbsp; One last  thing, some of code could benefit from some refactoring.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this books would be could a good reference point for data  binding in Microsoft ASP.NET.</p>
