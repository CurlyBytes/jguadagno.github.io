<p>The back cover of the book states that the intended audience is ...&quot;beginners  in the developer track who are looking to get an exposure to SSIS&quot;.&nbsp; It was  right on the money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The book starts off with the a great introduction to what SSIS is and what it  is made up of. In then goes into, in depth, how to use Visual Studio 2005 to  create, modify, debug and execute SSIS packages.&nbsp; The rest of the book is a  series of Hands On labs guiding you through different task like transferring  date from <em>xyz</em> source to SQL Server, which I find to be the best way for  me to learn a topic. There is one chapter on scripting with unfortunately for my  task a bit simple.&nbsp; It would have been nice to see an advanced script, maybe  something that calculated a value and updated a column.</p>
<p>There were two things that the book was missing... It did not talk about the  error handling or logging available in SSIS other than a mention that SSIS has  it.</p>
<p>In summary, this is a great book for beginners to SSIS and DBA's that what to  start using Visual Studio to debug their SSIS packages.</p>
