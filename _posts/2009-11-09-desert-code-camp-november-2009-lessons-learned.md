<p>My first Code Camp is done and I wanted to jot down some of the lessons I learned. </p>  <p><strong>Bring EXTRA equipment! </strong>You will never now what people will want or need. Here’s a list of items that are good to have.</p>  <ul>   <li>Adapters      <ul>       <li>DVI to VGA (those MACs) </li>        <li>HDMI to VGA </li>        <li>Multiple video to VGA </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Mice </li>    <li>CAT5 cables </li>    <li>USB Cables </li>    <li>USB Flash drive </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Speakers</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Speakers will cancel.&#160; It is an unfortunate fact. </li>    <li>Don’t allow one speaker to speak at more than 3 sessions.&#160; This reduces your risk in case of cancelation and prevents speaker fatigue. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Schedule</strong>.&#160; Printed schedules are good to have and good to hang.&#160; Also add speaker names to the presentations.</p>  <p><strong>Name Tags</strong>. People like and want them.</p>  <p><strong>Venue</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>WIFI is key.&#160; A reliable and unobtrusive WiFi connection is best. </li>    <li>You need to be able handle last minute room changes </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Food</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Make sure you provide the person(s) that are ordering the food explicit instructions on the food. </li>    <li>Try to have more than just pizza. </li>    <li>You should have vegetarian and vegan options. </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And remember <strong>you are not going to be able to make EVERYONE happy.</strong></p><div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="margin:0px; padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;"><br /><br /><script type="text/javascript">
