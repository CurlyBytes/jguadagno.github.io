				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to let you know about an upcoming event called Startup Weekend Chandler. Startup Weekend is a non-profit, community-building event that brings together entrepreneurs of all backgrounds including software developers, marketers, designers, and other enthusiasts to start companies in just 54 hours. The participants that attend have 60 seconds to make a pitch (optional), the pitches are whittled down to the top ideas, and then teams form around the ideas to come out with several developed companies or projects. Finally, the weekend culminates with demonstrations in front of an audience of judges and potential investors.</p>
<p>This is Chandler’s first Startup Weekend, but the event occurs all over the world throughout the year and they have been very successful. The event will be held the weekend of June 24th and more info is at <a href="http://chandler.startupweekend.org/">http://chandler.startupweekend.org</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the date for Desert Code Camp 2010.2, aka Nov2010 code camp.  It will take place <strong>Saturday, November, 13th, 2010</strong>.</p>
<p>There are a few changes to this camp.</p>
<h3>New Web Site</h3>
<p>The website has been changed to accommodate history in the Desert Code Camps. This means that each Code Camp will have its own URL, so you can see what sessions have taken place in the past.</p>
<p>This Desert Code Camp’s, 2010.2, URL is <a href="http://nov2010.desertcodecamp.com">http://nov2010.desertcodecamp.com</a> and is ready to accept sessions.</p>
<p>May 2010 Desert Code Camp, 2010.1 Desert Code Camp, is <a href="http://may2010.desertcodecamp.com">http://may2010.desertcodecamp.com</a>. I am in the process of adding in the Desert Code Camps from 2009. You can go to <a href="http://desertcodecamp.com">http://desertcodecamp.com</a> to get the list of Code Camps that the site has.</p>
<h3>New Location</h3>
<p><a href="http://www2.cgc.maricopa.edu/">Chandler-Gilbert Community College</a> will be hosting the event on their <a href="http://www.cgc.maricopa.edu/adminservices/maps/pecos/Pages/PecosCampus.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pecos Campus</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This facility is right off of the Loop 202 (Santan Freeway) and Gilbert Road at the intersection of Gilbert Rd and Pecos Rd, in Chandler, AZ.</li>
<li>The facility provides plenty of free parking</li>
<li>There is free wifi with no requirements or software installed on your pc.</li>
<li>There is a student center for socializing and networking.</li>
<li>Modern facilities. In fact, Desert Code Camp will most likely take place in their brand new <a href="http://www.cgc.maricopa.edu/adminservices/maps/pecos/Pages/pecos-i.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ironwood Hall</a> (IRN).</li>
<li>Larger room sizes.  We will be able to hold several 120+ sessions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Speaker Dinner</h3>
<p>I am going to try and have a speaker dinner also at this Desert Code Camp.  The speaker dinner will take place on Friday night, pending a sponsor. More information will be provided when we get closer. If you want to sponsor the speaker dinner for about 40 people, send me an email at jguadagno @ sevdnug.org.</p>
<h3>After Party</h3>
<p>We are working with the City of Chandler, and local businesses downtown to have several after parties going on in Downtown Chandler after the Code Camp.  Downtown Chandler is approximately 3 miles away from Chandler-Gilbert Community College.</p>
<p>If you want to help, shoot me an email at jguadagno @ sevdnug.org.</p>
<h3>Social Media</h3>
<p>This Desert Code Camp we want you to use all of the Social Media avenues you can. We have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Twitter Account: <a href="http://twitter.com/desertcodecamp">@DesertCodeCamp</a></li>
<li>A Facebook Group: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=121127197936341&amp;v=app_2344061033&amp;ref=ts#!/group.php?gid=121127197936341&amp;ref=ts">Facebook group</a></li>
<li>A Facebook Event: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=121127197936341&amp;v=app_2344061033&amp;ref=ts#!/event.php?eid=144666038890143&amp;ref=mf">Facebook Event</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hope to see you there!</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No not Chandler Bing from Friends, although maybe Monica <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> … it’s living in Chandler, Arizona. </p>
<p>In the past, I have tried to keep this blog mostly technical but something happened this morning that made me realize I love living in <a title="City of Chandler web site." href="http://www.chandleraz.gov" target="_blank">Chandler, Arizona</a>. I forgot to close my garage door last night and during the <a href="http://chandlerpd.com" target="_blank">City of Chandler Police Departments</a> nightly patrol, the officer closed the door for me and left me a nice little note/reminder. Way to go!</p>
<p>A bit of history… My wife and I spend quite some time researching different cities and parts of the country when deciding where would be the best location (in our opinion) to raise our family. After all the research and talking to some friends and almost family out here we decided to move to Chandler, Arizona. So about 5 years ago in June of 2005 we moved from Long Island, NY and left all our family and friends to move to Chandler, Arizona. </p>
<p>So why do I love living in Chandler, Arizona. There are many reasons. The City of Chandler is proactively looking to grow the City in ways that most cities do not attempt.&#160; The City of Chandler is hosting <a href="http://laidoffcampphoenix.com" target="_blank">Laid Off Camp Phoenix</a> on April 3rd, 2010.&#160; They attempted to host <a href="http://desertcodecamp.com" target="_blank">Desert Code Camp</a> on May 15th, 2010 (just not enough time to plan) and they are hosting <a href="http://azgivecamp.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Arizona Give Camp</a> on May 21st-May 23rd, 2010.</p>
<p>The City of Chandler does so much for its citizens, Day of Fun and Fitness, Family Easter celebrations, Chandler Jazz festival,&#160; and <a href="http://www.chandleraz.gov/newsreleasearchive.aspx" target="_blank">more</a>. The City of Chandler has won countless <a href="http://www.chandleraz.gov/default.aspx?pageid=22" target="_blank">awards</a> also.</p>
